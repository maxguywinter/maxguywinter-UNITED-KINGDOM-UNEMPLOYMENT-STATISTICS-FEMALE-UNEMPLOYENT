INTRODUCTION

This report provides statistics and analysis on United Kingdom (UK) female unemployment. The first aim of this report is to examine whether there was a difference between the proportion of unemployed females in 2019 and 2020 utilising the two datasets from the Office for National Statistics (ONS):

•	Female Unemployment rate (age 16 and over, seasonally adjusted) (ONS, 2021)

•	Labour Force Survey (LFS): International Labour Organisation (ILO): UK: Female: Aged 16 and over: Thousands: NSA (ONS, 2021) 

According to a House of Commons briefing paper (Brigid Francis Devine, 2021), females have experienced an increase in unemployment, benefit unemployment claims and have been furloughed more than men since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Consequently, this report hypothesis Covid-19 increased female unemployment more than male unemployment. To examine female unemployment rates between 2019 and 2020 and the impact of Covid-19 on unemployment, this report supplements the female unemployment datasets above with the Male Unemployment rate (age 16 and over, seasonally adjusted) (ONS, 2021) and the LFS: ILO: UK: Male: Aged 16 and over: Thousands: NSA (ONS, 2021) datasets from the ONS as a comparator. The female and male unemployment rates (age 16 and over, seasonally adjusted) show the proportion of those unemployed from 1971-2020. Whereas the LFS: ILO: UK: Male and Female (aged 16 and over: Thousands: NSA) datasets exhibit the number (thousands) of unemployed females and males from 1984 to 2020.

This report uses the datasets as they are the most recent data (released October 2021) from the ONS. Moreover, the ONS is politically independent and aims to follow the Code of Practise for Statistics (2021) to ensure its statistics given to the government and other institutions are of high quality, trustworthy and have public value. Therefore, the data is likely to be credible and not have political motivations or influence. Additionally, the supplementary datasets are comparable to the female unemployment datasets as they are both time-series data, use the same variables, measures, and concepts of unemployment. Consequently, more accurate conclusions can be drawn from the datasets to efficiently assess the difference between the proportion of unemployed females in 2019 and 2020 and if Covid-19 impacted female unemployment more than male unemployment.

Section 1.0 of this report illustrates descriptive statistics, graphical summaries and interrogates the ONS data sets above. Section 2.0 utilises hypothesis test (proportion test) to test if there is a difference between the proportion of unemployed females in 2019 and the proportion of unemployed females in 2020 and if Covid-19 impacted female unemployment more than male unemployment. Ultimately, Section 3.0 explains the results from the statistical tests from the previous section. This report concludes that the proportion of unemployed females in 2019 is not equal to the proportion of unemployed females in 2020. Moreover, the proportion of unemployed females in 2020 is less than the proportion of unemployed males in 2020. Hence, Covid-19 did not disproportionally increase female unemployment compared to male unemployment.

SECTION 1.0 DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND GRAPHICAL SUMMARIES

As stated above, section 1.0 shows descriptive statistics, graphical summaries and interrogates the ONS Female and Male Unemployment rate (age 16 and over, seasonally adjusted) datasets. Firstly, section 1.0 examines Figure 1, Figure 2, and Table 1, showing the trend of unemployment rates for females and males from 1971 to 2020, further discussed below. Secondly, focusing on the two years (2019 and 2020), Figure 3 and Table 2 provide quartile data on the female and male unemployment rates. Tables 1 and 2 figures have been rounded to two decimal places for the analysis.

Figure 1 above shows the female and male unemployment rate (age 16 and over, seasonally adjusted) from 1971 to 2020 using the ILO definition of unemployment. Likewise, Figure 2 uses the same unemployment definition as Figure 1 but shows the number of females and males unemployed (thousands). Both the figures above illustrate that male unemployment has been higher than female unemployment since 1984. Figure 1 and Table 1 below show that min unemployment rate for females was 3.6% in 2019, while males have had their lowest unemployment rate since 1971 of 3% both in 1973 and 1974. However, males experienced the highest unemployment rate of 12.3% in 1993 compared to the highest female unemployment rate of 11.6% in 1984.  Figure 1 and Figure 2 above highlight that female unemployment has increased from 585,000 (3.6%) in 2019, rising to 695,000 (4.3%) in 2020. Similarly, male unemployment increased from 722,000 (4%) to 855,000 (4.8%) from 2019 to 2020. Consequently, as the female unemployment rate increased from 3.6% (2019) to 4.3% (2020), Figures 1 and 2 indicate a difference between the proportion of unemployed females in 2019 and 2020. According to Francis-Devine (2021), the Covid-19 pandemic had an enormous effect on the UK labour market, unemployment, economic inactivity, and redundancies, all increasing. Therefore, it can be contended that the first rise of female employment since 2012 was due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Table 1. shows the mean and median that are both measures of central tendency. The sample mean is the average, and the median is the midpoint of a dataset. Male unemployment rates have a larger mean (7.2) and median (6.5) compared to female unemployment rates sample mean (6.4) and median (6.1). Thus, the sample mean illustrates that males, on average, have experienced higher unemployment rates than females. Additionally, Table 1 displays the interquartile range for females (2.5) and males (4.3). Rachel McCrea (2021) states the interquartile range is 'the range of the middle 50% of the data (IQR=Q3-Q1)' and is a more robust measure than the range as it is not affected by outliers. Therefore, male unemployment rates are more spread out compared to female unemployment rates. Moreover, the standard deviation measures the spread of the data around the mean. Females had a lower standard deviation (1.99) than males (2.75), thus exhibiting males having a greater unemployment rate spread than females.

Figure 3 displays the female and male unemployment rate (age 16 and over, seasonally adjusted) from 2019 quarter 1 (Q1) to 2020 quarter 4 (Q4). Therefore, Figure 3 shows a rise in unemployment rates for females and males from 2019 to 2020. In 2019 Q1, female unemployment was 3.7%, and male unemployment was at 3.9%, and by 2019 Q4, female unemployment had fallen to 3.6%, and male unemployment stayed the same. As stated above, the rise in unemployment rates from 2019 to 2020 has been attributed to Covid-19. The UK introduced measures such as the national lockdown to combat the virus in March 2020 (Q1). Figure 3 exhibits, since 2020 Q1, the unemployment rates for females (3.8%) and males (4.2%) increased and by the end of 2020 was 5% for females and 5.4% for males.

Akin to Table1, Table 2 displays the mean and median. Male unemployment rates have a larger mean (4.4) and median (4.6) compared to female unemployment rates sample mean (4.0) and median (3.8). The sample mean shows that males, on average, have experienced higher unemployment rates than females from 2019 Q1 to 2020 Q4. Furthermore, Table 2 also displays the interquartile range for females (0.6) and males (0.9). Consequently, male unemployment rates are more spread out compared to female unemployment rates. Likewise, Females had a lower standard deviation (0.5) than males (0.6), thus exhibiting males having a greater unemployment rate spread than females. 

The following section below employs proportion tests to assess the hypothesis of a difference between the proportion of unemployed females in 2019 and the proportion of unemployed females in 2020 and if Covid-19 increased female unemployment more than male unemployment.

SECTION 2.0 STATISTICAL METHODS

Section 2.0 uses a proportion test to firstly test if there is a difference between the proportion of unemployed females in 2019 and the proportion of unemployed females in 2020. Therefore, the first hypothesis tests null (H0) and alternative hypothesis (HA) are:

•	H0 = The proportion of unemployed females in 2019 is equal (=) to the proportion of unemployed females in 2020.
•	HA = The proportion of unemployed females in 2019 is not equal (≠) to the proportion of unemployed females in 2020.

The second proportion tests if Covid-19 impacted female unemployment more than male unemployment. Thus, the second hypothesis test is: 

•	H0 = The proportion of unemployed females in 2020 is greater than (≥) the proportion of unemployed males in 2020.
•	HA = The proportion of unemployed females in 2020 is less than (<) the proportion of unemployed males in 2020.

This report utilises a two-proportion test for the hypothesis testing as the aim is to compare two parameters. For the function prop.test (proportion test), the data is specified by a vector of values with x storing the counts and n the sample size. For example, for the first proportion test, x is the number of females unemployed in 2019 and 2020, and n (sample size) is the number of females unemployed/female unemployment rate for each year. Both proportions tests use a 0.05 significance level and thus a default 95% confidence interval. 

However, according to John Verzani (2014), the first proportion test should be two-tailed as the aim is to determine if there is any difference between the two groups. McCrea (2021) alleges that the second proportion test should be one-tailed as it aims to determine a specific question about the proportion. Hence, for the second proportion test, the argument alternative = "less" instead of the default (two.sided), thus specifying the alternative hypothesis and conducting a one-tailed test. Statistical tests make assumptions about the sampling procedure that was used to obtain the sample data. According to Verzani (2014), the proportion test makes the following assumptions:

•	Both groups (i.e. female unemployment 2019 and 2020) are a simple random sample

•	Group 1 (female unemployment 2019) is a sample taken from population 1 (female unemployment 2019), and group 2 (female unemployment 2020) is taken from population 2 (female unemployment 2020). Therefore, the samples are independent.

•	The assumptions for the binomial distribution are fulfilled by both populations. According to NCSS (2021), binomial distribution means that the probability of one of the possible two outcomes is constant for all subjects within the group. Furthermore, the response from one subject is independent of that of any other subject.

The following section below displays the results of the proportion tests and concludes from these results.

SECTION 3.0 RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

Proportion Test: Proportion of unemployed females in 2019 and the proportion of unemployed females in 2020
<img width="409" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97530878/153605299-38aeacbc-61c5-4100-8d6b-66a3f92db1f9.png">

The first proportion test above gives a p-value of < 2.2e-16, which is less than significance level alpha = 0.05. Consequently, there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the proportion of unemployed females in 2019 is equal to the proportion of unemployed females in 2020. Thus, it can be concluded that the alternative hypothesis is true (the proportion of unemployed females in 2019 is not equal to the proportion of unemployed females in 2020). 

It can be argued that the outcome of the proportion test intuitively makes sense and is expected as section 1.0 illustrates that from 2019 to 2020 female unemployment rate increased from 3.6% to 4.3%, and the number of females unemployed increased from 585,000 to 695,000. Therefore, it can be contended that the proportion of females unemployed increased from 2019 to 2020.

Proportion Test: The proportion of unemployed females in 2020 is greater than the proportion of unemployed males in 2020

Likewise, the second proportion test gives a p-value of < 2.2e-16, which is less than significance level alpha = 0.05. Therefore, there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the proportion of unemployed females in 2020 is greater than the proportion of unemployed males in 2020. Hence, it can be concluded that the alternative hypothesis is true (the proportion of unemployed females in 2020 is less than the proportion of unemployed males in 2020). Moreover, this result had been anticipated as section 1.0 exhibits the female unemployment rate (4.3%), and number (695,000) in 2020 was lower than the male unemployment rate (4.8%) and number (855,000). Additionally, the female unemployment rate and number increase from 2019 to 2020 was lower than the male figures. Thus, it can be contended that Covid-19 did not increase unemployment more for females than males.
